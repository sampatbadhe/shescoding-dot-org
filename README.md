# [She's Coding](http://shescoding.org)

This is the code for the [shescoding.org](http://shescoding.org) website.

### About *She's Coding*

*She's Coding* is an open-source website project currently under development in cooperation with the documentary film [CODE: Debugging the Gender Gap](http://www.codedoc.co/). Sheâ€™s Coding is meant to serve as the destination for anyone who wants to learn more about the gender gap problem in computer science and become part of the solution.

**Open-source?**

Yes! *She's Coding* is build by the community, for the community. We currently have a small group of volunteers bootstrapping the project, and we are in the process of defining some simple rules on how to contribute for the wider community.

### Installation

+ Install [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) (OSX):

  ```
  $ ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
  ```

+ Set the [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) version to 2.3.1. In order to be able to pick the ruby version or to download ruby, we recommend using a ruby version manager. There are 2 ruby version management tools: [rvm](https://rvm.io/) and [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv).

    ##### **RVM**
    ##### Installing **rvm** from scratch:

	+ Install [rvm](https://rvm.io/):
      ```
      $ \curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable
      ```

	+ Install [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/):
      ```
      $ rvm install 2.5.3
      ```

	+ Select this version of ruby for use in this project:
      ```
      $ rvm use 2.5.3
      ```

    ##### Set ruby version if you already have rvm installed:
    + Select this version for use:

      ```
      $ rvm use 2.5.3
      ```

    ##### **RBENV**
    ##### Installing **rbenv** from scratch:
    + Install [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv):
      ```
      $ brew install rbenv
      ```

	+ Install [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/):
      ```
      $ rbenv install 2.5.3
      ```

	+ Check ruby version:
      ```
      $ ruby -v
      ```
   	You should see ruby version printed as result: `ruby 2.3.1p112 (2016-04-26 revision 54768) [x86_64-darwin15]`


   ##### Set ruby version if you already have rbenv installed:

### Pre-commit hook

Please do not commit and push directly to the master branch! The hooks/pre-commit file in this repository contains a pre-commit hook that warns you if you are checking directly into master. In order to enable this hook, from the root of the repo do:
```
$ cp hooks/pre-commit .git/hooks/
$ chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit
```

### Running the tests

In order to run the tests, make sure all the gems are installed and the test environment is set up properly with working database.

+ Set up:

```
$ bundle install
$ bundle exec rake db:create RAILS_ENV=test
$ bundle exec rake db:schema:load RAILS_ENV=test
```

+ Run the tests with [RSpec Rails](https://github.com/rspec/rspec-rails):

```
$ bundle exec rspec -fd
```

Notes:
+ ```-fd``` stands for full details. You can also run tests by using commands ```bundle exec rspec``` or ```bundle exec rake``` to get an overview without details of each test.
+ If you are having trouble running bundle install, please make sure Nokogiri gem is installed on your machine. Full instructions can be found [here](http://www.nokogiri.org/tutorials/installing_nokogiri.html).
